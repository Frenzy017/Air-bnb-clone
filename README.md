# Air-bnb-clone

This is the first item me using React so I learn quite couple of things:

- JSX / React syntax
- How props function and what are they
- Mapping data over components, making it easier to reformat code, not hard coding it.
- Passing an object as props to a different component
- First time using Vite, a tool for front-end template focusing on popular frameworks.
